### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one one of my favorite labs because it was the start of my coding projects. I had no prior experience in coding so print Hello.cc was very fun and interesting. Although we did not do much in lab 1, it was an eye opening experience to me. I learned the basics of tests, format checks, and more from lab 1.

* Lab 4
    
    Lab 4 Part 2 was fun to make. There were two players involved in the Hi-lo game which was interesting to implement in my code. I enjoyed how I was able to create these functions to work with the if statements. Overall, this lab was not too difficult but very tedious. This lab's instructions were very appealing and fun to code with. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 Part 2 was another of my favorite labs because it introduced me to the game of Blackjack. I never knew how to play card games so creating a program where I could write the values of each hands was super interesting and fun. I enjoyed formulating all the different types of syntaxes we learned from our lecture classes to incorporate it to our game.
